# Udacity-Neighborhood-Map
The Neighborhood Map project for Udacity is a single page application that displays a map of a neighborhood as well as a few points of interested marked on the map.  This application uses the Google maps API to provide the map on the page as well as the markers of the points of interest.  The Wikipedia API is also used to create links to wikipedia articles that are around the areas of the points of interest.  This application was built using the Knockout JS framework.


## How to run the application

1. Start by downloading all of the files and folders in this git repository onto your computer.
2. Open the "neighborhoodmap.html" file.  This should open a web browser and display the application.


## How to use the Neighborhood Map app

Clicking on a list item will cause the marker to bounce and display an infowindow with additional information about the location.  Clicking on a marker on the map will also cause the marker to bounce and display an infowindow with additional information about the location.

The location list can also be filtered by using a keyword search.  Enter text into the filter text box and the location list will be filtered based on the text entered.
