# Udacity-Neighborhood-Map
The Neighborhood Map project for Udacity is a single page application that displays a list of locations in a neighborhood and a map of the neighborhood with the locations marked on the map.  This application uses the Google maps API to provide the map on the page as well as the markers of the locations.  The Wikipedia API is also used to list a maximum of 5 linked articles that are within 3000 meters of the selected location.  This application was built using the Knockout JS framework.


## How to run the application

1. Start by downloading all of the files and folders in this git repository onto your computer.
2. Open the "index.html" file.  This should open a web browser and display the application.


## How to use the Neighborhood Map app
This application displays a list of points of interests around the neighborhood of Castro Valley, CA.  It also displays a map with markers that indicate where these locations are.

Clicking on a location in the list will cause the location marker on the map to bounce and display an infowindow with additional information about the location.  You can also click on a marker on the map to display the information about that location.

The location list can also be filtered by using a keyword search.  Enter text into the filter text box and the location list will be filtered based on the text entered.  The location markers on the map will also be filtered based on the keyword typed into the filter.



## Attribution:
The Wikipedia API was used for this project to fetch articles around the points of interest.
